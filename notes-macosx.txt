To compile Pencil for OS X Power PC "out of the box"
0) Install XCode and Apple Developer Kit if you haven't done it
1) Install Qt from TrollTech if you haven't done it
2) open a terminal, and go to the folder where pencil.pro is located
3) type "qmake"
4) this generates a file called "pencil.xcodeproj"
5) open it with XCode and press the build button

====================================================================
Qt on Mac
-> The Qt framework is needed to create the graphical interface of Pencil
Use the installer from Trolltech
www.trolltech.com
I've used Qt 4.3.0

====================================================================
Ming (Flash/SWF library) on Mac
-> The Ming library enables Pencil to export animation to the Flash/SWF format
www.libming.org
I've used Ming 0.3
Because of some obscure library name conflict on the Mac, I couldn't use Ming as a dynamic library.
(I think this is because Ming links against libpng which is also present in the System/Library/ApplicationServices as libPng.
If anyone manages to use Ming (with PNG support) a dynamic library, please let me know.)

Instead I had to use it a static library
I put the compiled library (libming.a) and the header files (*.h) in
the "libmacosx" directory, as a convenience, so that you don't need to compile it yourself
(maybe you need on an Intel Mac, though).
If needed, you can get the latest files from www.libming.org and compile them yourself.

========================
Deploying Pencil/Mac OS X
I chose to ship the Qt libraries within the app.
In order to link the pencil.app against these local Qt libraries, I made the script "linkmac"
After Pencil is build, simply run ./linkmac
(the very first time, please uncomment the first lines in the script in order to copy the Qt libraries from /usr/local to the pencil.app package.)
